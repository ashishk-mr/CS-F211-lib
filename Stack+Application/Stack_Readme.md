## Stack Data structure Implementation
* Implemented using Linked List
* Data to be entered in the stack be stored in the file, the name of the file must be passed as command line argument
* In terminal **_$ make runstack_** to compile the dependencies
* **_$ ./a.out "sample file name"_** to run

## Infix<->Prefix<->Postfix interconversion and Pre/Post-fix evaluation
* Important application of stack data structure
* **_$ make run_** to compile, **_./a.out_** to run the program
